# Add posthog survey to an appropriate point in the user flow

## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Up to codex to determine when. Make sure that users don't see it twice. Codex should scan the entire flow, identify every mechanic and thing that users can do, and identify when to show the survey - it shouldn't be too early or too late. Survey: https://us.posthog.com/external_surveys/019bb036-6cd7-0000-fc06-1c83a01e7759
