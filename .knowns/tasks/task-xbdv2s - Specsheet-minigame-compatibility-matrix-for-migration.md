# Specsheet: minigame compatibility matrix for migration

## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a cross-referenced specsheet covering all citizen-science projects/minigames, their components/chapters, routes, tests, mechanics, and visual parity constraints to preserve behavior during architecture migration.
Primary spec: specs/migration/minigame-compatibility-matrix-and-parity-contract
Primary spec path: .knowns/docs/specs/migration/minigame-compatibility-matrix-and-parity-contract.md
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Every project/minigame has route+component mapping
- [x] #2 Each project lists current test coverage and gaps
- [x] #3 Spec defines no-regression behavior and visual parity checklist
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
- Spec reference: specs/migration/minigame-compatibility-matrix-and-parity-contract
Created compatibility matrix spec with chapter refs, project/component/route/test mapping, parity contract, and migration validation checklist.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->
