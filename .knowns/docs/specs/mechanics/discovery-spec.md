# Discovery Spec

## Goal

Users can view meaningful discovery outputs derived from classification and deployment activity.

## User Stories

- As a player, I can open discovery surfaces and see recent/eligible discoveries.
- As a player, I can open a discovery detail page from IDs/links.
- As a player, I can understand discovery type labels and context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Discovery lists map known classification types to stable labels.
- Discovery pages handle invalid or missing IDs gracefully.
- Discovery data updates when upstream classification/deployment data changes.
