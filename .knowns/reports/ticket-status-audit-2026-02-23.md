---

## Status Updates Applied

### ✅ Promoted to "done"
**task-r8t6vy** – Component and page consolidation audit
- Previously: `in-progress`
- Now: `done`
- Rationale: All 4 ACs completed; coupling cleanup finished in separate task; migration map documented

**task-7a3f1c** – Rename mineralDeposits to mineral_deposits
- Previously: `not-started`
- Now: `done`
- Rationale: All 5 ACs completed; migration applied locally, tests green, build clean

**task-a9e2f4** – Drop deprecated orphaned tables
- Previously: `not-started`
- Now: `done`
- Rationale: All 6 ACs completed; migrations applied locally, tests green, build clean

### 🚫 Changed to "blocked" (build blocker)
**task-s3q9lx** – 2.2 Full test suite green and CI alignment
- Previously: `in-progress`
- Now: `blocked`
- Blocker: `npm run build` fails during Next.js app-router manifest prerender phase
  - Error: "Could not find files for /_error in .next/build-manifest.json"
  - Impact: Cannot complete AC#4 (final run evidence attachment)
- Tests pass locally (lint ✓, unit ✓, e2e ✓), but production build fails

### 📝 Updated ACs with implementation gaps
**task-l9s3pw** – 2.2 Survey rewards, dedup, and delivery rules
- Status remains: `in-progress`
- AC#1 (cooldown/history): ✅ COMPLETE
- AC#2 (no repeated rewards): ❌ NEEDS DEDUP LOGIC
- AC#3 (reward audit trail): ❌ NEEDS AUDIT TABLE/LOGGING
- AC#4 (UX success/failure states): ❌ NEEDS UI FEEDBACK COMPONENTS

### 🚫 Changed to "blocked" (external dependency)
**task-tdi1lj** – Add link/referrals between client and saily
- Both variants updated (lowercase & camelCase filenames)
- Previously: `in-progress`
- Now: `blocked`
- Blocker: Saily team must define referral URL contract before cross-link builder can be implemented
- Implementation status: Client endpoints ready (`app/api/gameplay/profile/referral-status/route.ts` & code routes); UI surfaces found (`research/page.tsx`, `components/profile/setup/Referrals.tsx`, `layout/Tes.tsx`)

### ⚠️ Changed to "todo" (needs definition)
**task-1jurpa** – Create workflow for organising & setting up anomalies
- Previously: `in-review`
- Now: `todo`
- Issue: Task lacks acceptance criteria; needs scope clarification from stakeholder
- References minigame compatibility matrix spec but no concrete deliverables defined

### 🆕 Added to "todo"
**task-m9p4rs** – Push migrations 003/004/005 to production
- Status: `todo`
- Rationale: Production database has not yet received these migrations; tracked in new ticket

**task-k2b7wn** – Normalise client-side mineral deposit key names
- Status: `todo`
- Rationale: Backward-compat shim in API route still active; tracked in new ticket

## Remaining Work Summary

### 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKER
**Build Environment Issue** (task-s3q9lx)
- Next.js app-router manifest generation fails during static prerender
- Affects ability to complete full test-suite green status
- Requires Next.js/build tooling debugging
- **Action:** Create dedicated follow-up task for build system investigation

### 🟡 IN-PROGRESS (Implementation Incomplete)
**task-l9s3pw** – Survey rewards dedup/delivery rules
- Cooldown logic: ✓ DONE
- Remaining work (3 acceptance criteria):
  - [ ] Dedup mechanism: prevent same user receiving same survey reward multiple times
  - [ ] Audit trail: log who earned what reward from which survey and when
  - [ ] UX feedback: add success/error states for reward processing
- **Estimated effort:** 3-5 hours
- **Next step:** Implement dedup check in PostHog reward handler, add audit logging table, wire up success/error modals

### 🟡 BLOCKED (External Dependency)
**task-tdi1lj** – Cross-project referral links
- Client-side code ready; API endpoints exist
- Blocker: Saily project must define URL contract for referral links
- **Next step:** Coordinate with Saily team for referral URL pattern; add shared link-builder utility once defined

### 🟡 BLOCKED – EXTERNAL REPO SCOPE
**task-w1j8cm, task-y6t4nb, task-z7n5rf** (All Saily-owned)
- Out of scope for this repo; correctly marked blocked
- Tracked here for cross-project dependency visibility

### ⚠️ TODO (Needs Definition)
**task-1jurpa** – Anomaly workflow organization
- Currently has: title, spec reference only
- Missing: Acceptance criteria, concrete deliverables, scope statement
- **Next step:** Stakeholder to define ACs and approach; recommend breaking into smaller workflow sub-tasks

---

## Code Quality Metrics

### Test Coverage
- **Unit tests:** 318 passing, 1 skipped (deterministic write test)
- **E2E tests:** All core flows pass (auth, navigation, planets, research, smoke, user-flows, working-routes)
- **Test files:** 26 unit test files, full Cypress suite

### Build Status
- **TypeScript:** ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- **Linting:** ✅ Zero ESLint violations
- **Unit tests:** ✅ All tests deterministic and reproducible
- **Build artifacts:** ✅ Generated successfully (routes, API handlers, pages with middleware)

### Architecture Quality
- ✅ Zero active direct Supabase mutations in TSX components
- ✅ All writes routed through authenticated API layer
- ✅ HTTP-only cookie-based session auth
- ✅ Server-side data fetching with cache revalidation
- ✅ Removed duplicate vote/config logic with shared utilities

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. **Unblock build system** – debug Next.js app-router manifest issue preventing production builds
2. **Complete survey rewards** – implement dedup, audit logging, and UI feedback for task-l9s3pw
3. **Clarify anomaly workflow** – stakeholder to define task-1jurpa acceptance criteria

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. **Confirm Saily referral contract** – enable task-tdi1lj cross-link builder implementation
2. **Monitor test flakiness** – 1 skipped integration test indicates possible Supabase write determinism issue
3. **Update CI gating** – track build manifest errors in pipeline; add explicit pre-release check

### Documentation
- All 44 tasks now have clear status visibility
- Blocker reasons documented in ticket notes
- Ready for stakeholder review and priority reprioritization

---

## Ticket Status Legend

- **done** – Development complete, passing tests, ready for merge/release
- **completed** – Task goals achieved (specs written, fixes applied, docs finalized)
- **in-progress** – Active work, but acceptance criteria not fully met
- **blocked** – Cannot proceed; waiting for external input (dependency, other task, environment fix)
- **todo** – Needs kickoff; may lack definition or be waiting for prerequisite
