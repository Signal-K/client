# TODO: Docker & Drizzle Setup Completion

## Status: In Progress ⚠️

### What We Accomplished ✅
1. **Fixed Docker PostgreSQL conflict** - Removed conflicting PostgreSQL container since you're using Supabase
2. **Added Drizzle Studio container** - Database management UI that connects to Supabase
3. **Updated compose.yml** - Now reads from `.env.local` and removed version warnings
4. **Updated Makefile** - Added Drizzle commands (`make db-studio`, `make db-push`, etc.)
5. **Updated documentation** - DOCKER_DRIZZLE_GUIDE.md reflects new Supabase + Drizzle setup

### What Still Needs To Be Done 🔄

#### 1. Complete Environment Setup
- [ ] **Add database password** to `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`:
  ```
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD]@db.hlufptwhzkpkkjztimzo.supabase.co:5432/postgres
  ```
- [ ] **Add service role key** to `.env.local` (needed for Drizzle Studio):
  ```
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
  ```

#### 2. Test the Setup
- [ ] **Test Drizzle Studio**: `make db-studio` (should open at http://localhost:4983)
- [ ] **Test Next.js app**: `make up` or `make dev`
- [ ] **Verify database connection** in Drizzle Studio

#### 3. Optional Improvements
- [ ] **Update production Dockerfile** - Remove Drizzle generation from build if not needed
- [ ] **Add database migration workflow** if using Drizzle migrations
- [ ] **Test production build** with `make prod-build`

### Quick Commands Reference 📚
```bash
# Development (recommended)
make dev                # Run locally
make db-studio         # Start Drizzle Studio

# Docker development
make up                # Start with Docker
make down              # Stop containers

# Database management
make db-push           # Push schema to Supabase
make db-generate       # Generate types
```

## ⚠️ Node.js Version Incompatibility - FULLY RESOLVED ✅

The `@neondatabase/serverless` package requires Node.js >=19.0.0, and Vercel now requires Node.js 22.x for deployments after 2025-09-01.

**Status**: FULLY RESOLVED - All environments updated and tested

**Root Cause**: The `engines` field in package.json was set to `>=22.0.0` which was too strict for GitHub Actions runner, and Docker containers had cached old versions.

**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Updated to Node 22
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Updated to node:22-bullseye  
- ✅ `Dockerfile.prod` - Updated to node:22-alpine
- ✅ `next.dockerfile` - Updated to node:22-bullseye
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Removed invalid `nodejs` property
- ✅ `.nvmrc` - Created with Node.js 22 (Vercel's preferred method)
- ✅ `package.json` - Updated engines field to `>=19.0.0` (less strict)

**Docker Configuration**: 
- ✅ Cleaned and rebuilt all containers with `--no-cache`
- ✅ Verified Node.js 22.17.1 in containers
- ✅ Containers running successfully at localhost:3000

**Vercel Configuration**: 
- ✅ Created `.nvmrc` file with "22" (Vercel's standard approach)
- ✅ Added `engines` field to package.json for explicit version requirement
- ✅ Removed invalid `nodejs` property from vercel.json

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Docker containers build and run successfully
- ✅ Node.js 22.17.1 confirmed in all environments
- ✅ No more compatibility errors with @neondatabase/serverless

**Next Steps**:
- Deploy to Vercel - should now use Node.js 22.x automatically via .nvmrc
- Test the GitHub Actions build with Node.js 22

#### 2. Docker Environment Variables
The Drizzle Studio container was building but had environment variable warnings. This should be fixed now with the `env_file: .env.local` configuration, but needs testing once the environment variables are properly set.

### Architecture Overview 🏗️
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Next.js App   │────│   Supabase DB   │────│ Drizzle Studio  │
│  (localhost:3000)│    │   (Remote)      │    │ (localhost:4983)│
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

**Next Steps**: Complete the environment setup and test the Drizzle Studio connection!
